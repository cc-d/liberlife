Here's a rough rundown on how the python namespace structure is defined:

1. **Core Application Namespace**:
   - Start with a primary namespace (or directory) that houses the core components of the application, such as `app/`.
   - This foundational namespace is where primary configurations and orchestrations lie.

2. **Concept-Specific Namespaces**:
   - Organize primary concepts (like goals, users) into their own namespaces (e.g., `goal/`, `user/`).
   - By segmenting based on concepts, you maintain modularity and ensure each idea is self-contained, promoting maintainability.

3. **Database Namespace Organization**:
   - Dedicate a namespace, like `db/`, for database-related functionalities.
   - Within it, incorporate sub-namespaces or modules for:
     - Conceptual models: Representing the structure associated with each concept.
     - Session management: Handling database connections and their lifecycle.

4. **Routing Namespaces**:
   - Designate a namespace for routing, say, `routes/`.
   - Inside the routing namespace, segment further based on the various concepts they serve. This ensures that the routing logic for each concept remains distinct and isolated.

5. **Schema & Validation Namespaces**:
   - Establish a namespace for schema definitions, perhaps `schemas/`.
   - Centralizing schemas ensures there's a go-to spot for data validation and structure relating to different concepts.

6. **Utility & Helper Namespaces**:
   - Initiate a utilities namespace, possibly `utils/`, to manage shared functionalities.
   - Here, shared functions, middlewares, or tools find a home, ensuring they're easily accessible but not causing clutter elsewhere.

7. **Testing Namespaces**:
   - Arrange tests under a specific namespace like `tests/`.
   - Subcategorize within this based on the nature (unit, integration) or the concepts under test.

8. **Importance of Relative Imports**:
   - With structured namespaces, relative imports become crucial. They not only make the code cleaner but also maintain the module's integrity.

   - By using relative imports, you can easily refactor or move modules around without breaking dependencies.

   - For example, within the goal namespace, you might use a relative import like from .utils import some_function rather than specifying the full path. This helps in maintaining the modular structure and reducing coupling between components.

   - Relative imports also reinforce the idea of treating each namespace or directory as its independent module, aiding in understanding the codebase hierarchy and dependencies.

   - **MOST IMPORTANTLY** this keeps the namespace clean and prevents long names or single monolithic packages/modules, and avoids any sort of overlap or ambiguity with other packages/modules on the `PYTHONPATH`.

Through structured namespace management, focusing on conceptual segregation, developers can efficiently navigate the codebase, reduce naming collisions, and encourage a maintainable and scalable project.

## TLDR

**1. Concept: Core Application**
```plaintext
app/
├── config.py
└── main.py
```

**2. Concept: User, Goal & Task**

- **CRUD Operations**:
```plaintext
crud/
├── user.py
├── goal.py
└── task.py (assuming task operations are here)
```

- **Routing Logic**:
```plaintext
routes/
├── user.py
├── goal.py
└── task.py (assuming task routes are here)
```

- **Data Schemas**:
```plaintext
schemas/
├── user.py
├── goal.py
└── task.py (assuming task schema is here)
```

**3. Concept: Database Interaction**
```plaintext
db/
├── models.py
└── session.py
```

**4. Concept: Utilities**
```plaintext
utils/
├── security.py
└── middleware.py
```

**5. Concept: Testing**
```plaintext
tests/
├── integration/
│   ├── test_goals.py
│   └── test_user.py
└── unit/
    └── __old_mock_tests.py
```
